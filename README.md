# Arms Trade Analysis (2020-2023)

## 📊 Project Overview
A comprehensive analysis of global arms transfers from 2020-2023 using data from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and World Bank economic indicators. This project identifies geopolitical patterns, economic drivers, and strategic relationships in the international arms trade.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze arms transfer patterns among top importing nations
- Identify key supplier-recipient relationships and geopolitical blocs
- Examine economic correlations with arms procurement strategies
- Visualize global arms trade networks and trends

## 📈 Data Sources
- **SIPRI Arms Transfers Database** (2020-2023) - Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
- **World Bank Indicators** - GDP, military expenditure (% of GDP), population

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Performed in Excel and Python (Pandas):
- Preprocessed raw SIPRI and World Bank data in Excel for initial inspection and formatting
- Cleaned and structured arms transfer data with 18 key columns
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency
- Converted data types for analysis-readiness
- Merged datasets on country and year
- Handled missing values and standardized country names
- Used TIV (Trend Indicator Value) for fair comparison across weapon types
- Focused on 2020-2023 period covering major geopolitical shifts

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

### 1. Top Importers & Exporters Analysis
- Identified top 10 arms importing countries based on total TIV value
- Analyzed major supplier countries and their market share
- Calculated import/export concentration and diversification

### 2. Network & Relationship Mapping
- Created comprehensive supplier-recipient relationship tables
- Built interactive Sankey diagrams visualizing arms flow patterns
- Identified key geopolitical partnerships and dependencies

### 3. Economic Correlation Studies
- Analyzed relationship between GDP and arms import volumes
- Examined military expenditure patterns vs actual acquisitions
- Studied population size impact on arms procurement strategies

### 4. Temporal & Delivery Analysis
- Distinguished between order years and delivery years
- Analyzed delivery timelines and backlog patterns
- Identified trends across the 2020-2023 period

## 💡 Major Insights

### Geopolitical Patterns
- Clear supplier spheres of influence (US/Western vs Russian/Chinese blocs)
- Regional concentration of arms transfers to Middle East and Asia
- Strategic partnerships revealed through exclusive supplier relationships

### Economic Drivers
- Strong correlation between military expenditure (% of GDP) and arms imports
- GDP size as significant but not sole determinant of import volumes
- Identification of countries with strategic vs economic procurement patterns

### Strategic Implications
- Countries with single-supplier dependencies identified
- Analysis of diversification strategies in arms procurement
- Impact of geopolitical events on trade patterns

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Python Libraries
- `pandas` for data manipulation and aggregation
- `plotly` for interactive visualizations
- `numpy` for numerical computations

### Key Visualizations
- Interactive Sankey diagrams for trade flows
- Scatter plots for economic correlations
- Bar charts for market share analysis
- Network graphs for relationship mapping
